My grading scale is as follows:\r\n\r\nMint (M)\r\nAbsolutely perfect in every way. Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed. I use this rarely if ever.\r\n\r\nNear Mint (NM)\r\nA nearly perfect record. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. \r\n\r\nVery Good Plus (VG+)\r\nA Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don&#39;t affect the listening experience. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear also and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount.\r\n\r\nVery Good (VG)\r\nMany of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG disc. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song&#39;s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound.

We are Swap Meet Swamp Rats! Our &quot;bread & butter&quot; has evolved into vintage key holders. The story simple but not all that sweet. In the 1990s we were a large wholesale distributor for the one of the largest Leather Key Fob producers in the world. We helped design some of the vintage automobile logos and offered our guidance with respect to the transportation product line.  These type of items are truly our passion.  Unfortunately, the company was more concerned about supplying novelty key chains to Walmart.  The end result was that the company closed it&#39;s doors many years ago, leaving us high and dry with just the inventory on hand to make ends meet. It was then that we started handcrafting our key holders one at a time using simple tools such as a dremel, a hand vise and JB weld. Many of the items we sell on etsy are &quot;on-off&quot; items, such as the money clips, business card holders and leather key fobs. These are handcrafted on my work bench using a dremel and cold welding techniques. Recently, I have learned that I have out grown my storage area for all the many various pieces of Automobilia which I have accumulated over many decades. This realization will eventually lead to numerous collectibles being offered at &quot;garage sale&quot; prices on etsy, my favorite place to do internet sales. You will therefore many license plates, paper advertising, knick knacks, emblems, parts, and anything relating to the old car, old truck, antique motorcycle and gasoline products from back in the day. From the Eccentric to the eclectic, from rustic to rusty Rat Rod. Orphan cars, odd ball,  weird-o and &quot;one-off&quot; items are our speciality and the items are all listed at a price that you can actually afford. Excitement without the hype.

We have been actively selling our products on &quot;other&quot; auction sites for 15 years now, but feel that etsy provides a &quot;better fit&quot; audience for our unique products. ","policy_payment":"Although other payments are accepted, we prefer payment by Money Order or Cashiers Check. Paypal and similar payments are subject to additional fees that we like to shy away from to keep our costs down and pass our savings over to you.","policy_shipping":"All items are shipped out using the United States Postal Service. We take pride in shipping out within 24 hours of a payment that is received or cleared. Sometimes during the summer months this may not be possible as we do travel the Northeast to the various swap meets from May through the end of September. So please bear with us on  weekend orders placed during these months. Many items that we offer are delicate. Although the cost for insured shipping is always optional, we will always strongly suggest going the extra yard and purchasing insurance when an item is extremely fragile. We do practice &quot;Safe Shipping&quot; -All items are hand packaged with care using proper packaging materials.","policy_refunds":"We will refund all items that have been sent back to us or is in the process of being shipped back to us within 7 days from which the item was recieved by the  buyer. The only two exceptions to note: Any package lost, or damaged  that has not been insured by the buyer, and, any International Shipment. Unfortunately and in most cases, the United States Post Office does not actually guarantee delivery to a foreign country even if a tracking number has been issued. It has been our experience that the USPS has no control over other another country&#39;s postal service handling of a package and therefore, acts accordingly. \r\n\r\nAlthough we try our darndest to keep our &quot;etsy&quot; inventory from our &quot;road show&quot; stuff, there are times when items do get mixed up. The worst case scenario is that &quot;one-off&quot; items are sold on the road while still showing for sale on etsy. We realize that this is our fault entirely and prompt refunds will be returned with our apologies. This rarely happens, but it does, and we felt the need to have it addressed here. ","policy_additional":"Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. Aside from selling the handcrafted imported vintage folk art that you see on Etsy,  we have a clear passion for antique automobiles and related transportation memorabilia. If you should have or know of anything along these lines for sale, please contact us as well. We are frequent visitors to many New York and New England Car Shows.
